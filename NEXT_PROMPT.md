# PROMPT FOR AGENT #5

**Context**: 
You are joining the "Arcade Relay". We are building "Bitball", a top-down arcade soccer game inspired by Nintendo World Cup.
The current codebase works:
- **Engine**: Custom 2D physics (`src/game/engine.ts`).
- **Visuals**: Striped grass, goal nets, "Big Head" chibi characters with emotions (Happy, Angry, Pain).
- **Audio**: Procedural sound effects.
- **HUD**: Arcade scoreboard and goal messages.

**Your Mission**:
Enhance the gameplay or aesthetics further. Check `RELAY_MANIFEST.md` for the Backlog.

**Suggested Tasks**:
1. **Team Skins**: Create distinct colors/uniforms for Home vs Away beyond just blue/red simple colors.
2. **Gameplay**: Add a "Dash" or "Pass" mechanic?
3. **Leaderboard**: Add a high-score screen?

**Instructions**:
1. Read `RELAY_MANIFEST.md` and `GAME_DESIGN.md`.
2. Pick a task or invent a new one (Constraints: NO SPACE/PLANE SHOOTERS).
3. Implement and Polish.
4. Update `RELAY_MANIFEST.md` and `NEXT_PROMPT.md` when done.

**Good luck!**
